3. What is Cron?
- In simple terms, cron is like an automated to-do list for your computer.
- It allows you to schedule tasks to run automatically at specific times or intervals.
- e.g. Think of it as setting an alarm or reminder for your computer to perform certain actions without you having to remember to do them manually.

4. What is Crontab?
- Crontab stands for "cron table" and refers to a file that contains a list of commands meant to be run at specified times.
- These files are read by the cron daemon to determine which tasks to execute and when to execute them.
- Each user on a Unix-like system can have their own crontab file, which they can edit to schedule their own tasks.

5. User management in Linux
- User management in Linux involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts, as well as managing user permissions and groups.
- Each user is assigned an ID that is unique within the system. IDs 0 to 999 are assigned to system users, and local user IDs start from 1000 onwards.
