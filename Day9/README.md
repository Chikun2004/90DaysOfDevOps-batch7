Shell Scripting Challenge Directory Backup with Rotation.

Task is to create a bash script that takes a directory path as a command-line argument and performs a backup of the directory. The script should create timestamped backup folders and copy all the files from the specified directory into the backup folder.

Additionally, the script should implement a rotation mechanism to keep only the last 3 backups. This means that if there are more than 3 backup folders, the oldest backup folders should be removed to ensure only the most recent backups are retained.
