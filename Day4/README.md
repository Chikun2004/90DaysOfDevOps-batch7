Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers-

Welcome to the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge with the #TrainWithShubham Community!

What is Kernel?
- The kernel is the heart of an operating system. It's the core software that sits between the hardware and applications. 
- The kernel's job is to manage the system's resources, like the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.
- It handles tasks such as memory allocation, process management, and device communication, making sure everything runs smoothly and securely.

What is Linux Shell Scripting?
- Linux shell scripting involves writing a series of commands for the shell, which is the command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. 
- These scripts can automate tasks, manage system operations, and perform complex sequences of commands without requiring user intervention.

Why Use Shell Scripting?
- Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks to save time.
- Consistency: Ensure tasks are performed the same way every time.
- Power: Perform complex tasks by combining simple commands.
- Flexibility: Easily modify and adapt scripts to different needs.

What Shell Scripting means for DevOps?
- In the context of DevOps, shell scripting is an essential skill. It allows DevOps engineers to automate, configure, and manage IT infrastructure efficiently.
- Shell scripts can be used to automate repetitive tasks, deploy applications, manage servers, and facilitate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- By leveraging shell scripts, DevOps teams can improve consistency, speed, and reliability in their workflows.
- e.g. Imagine you're a DevOps engineer, and you need to deploy a new version of an application to several servers. Manually logging into each server, stopping the application, updating the code, and starting the application again would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, you write a shell script to automate this process.

What is #!/bin/bash? Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
- The line #!/bin/bash at the beginning of a shell script is called a shebang (or hashbang).
- It tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
- Yes we can write #!/bin/sh at the beginning of a script. This specifies that the script should be run using the sh shell, which is a more basic and portable shell compared to Bash. While Bash includes many advanced features and extensions, sh is more universally available across different Unix-like systems.
