Docker volumes and Docker networking

1.Docker Volume
- A Docker volume is a way to store data outside the container filesystem, enabling data persistence across container restarts and deployments.
- Volumes are managed by Docker and can be easily created, used, and removed.
- Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

2.Docker Network
- Container networking refers to the ability for containers to connect to and communicate with each other, or to non-Docker workloads.
- Containers have networking enabled by default, and they can make outgoing connections.
- A container has no information about what kind of network it's attached to, or whether their peers are also Docker workloads or not.
- A container only sees a network interface with an IP address, a gateway, a routing table, DNS services, and other networking details. That is, unless the container uses the none network driver.


3.Task 1
- Create a multi-container docker-compose file that will bring up and bring down containers in a single shot (e.g., create application and database containers).
- Use the docker-compose up command with the -d flag to start a multi-container application in detached mode.
- Use the docker-compose scale command to increase or decrease the number of replicas for a specific service. You can also add replicas in the deployment file for auto-scaling.
- Use the docker-compose ps command to view the status of all containers, and docker-compose logs to view the logs of a specific service.
- Use the docker-compose down command to stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the application.

4.Task 2
- Learn how to use Docker Volumes and Named Volumes to share files and directories between multiple containers.
- Create two or more containers that read and write data to the same volume using the docker run --mount command.
- Verify that the data is the same in all containers by using the docker exec command to run commands inside each container.
- Use the docker volume ls command to list all volumes and the docker volume rm command to remove the volume when you're done.
